for kmean clustering its important to determine the optimal value for k, k represents number of cluster in which data set can be divide optimally .

for every cluster number ratio of betweeness (The between-cluster sum of squares) to totss (the total sum of squares ) is determine . by graph its threshold value is determined to find k value . each graph showing different k value .
